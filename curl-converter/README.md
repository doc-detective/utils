# cURL to httpRequest Converter

This utility helps convert curl commands to Doc Detective httpRequest steps. It's a barebones tool, but it works well, identifying URLs, headers, and request body objects. It doesn't do *any* validation.

1. Download `curl_to_dd.html`.
2. Open it in your browser.
3. Paste in your curl command.
4. Click **Convert**.

Might incorporate similar functionality into the [Action Builder](https://doc-detective.com/app) at some point, but this is here for now.
